<h1> Welcome to the prologue </h1>
<p>With short chainstays, medium reach, high bottom bracket and a slack headtube. </p>
<p>It is the perfect bike for narrow steep or flat quick turning trails with lots of roots and rocks</p>
<p>It can support 29" tires as wide as 3" in the rear while using a regular BSA bottom bracket.</p>
<p>This makes it perfect for use in sand and snow when the seasons change.</p>
<p>What really makes us love this frame though is its rigity. The rear seatstays pass the</p>
<p>seat tube and attach to the top tube and the seat tube making for less flex left to right!</p>
